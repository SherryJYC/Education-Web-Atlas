    A unicorn company is a private company with a valuation over $1 billion. 
    As of January 2020, there are 14 EdTech Unicorns around the world who have collectively raised over $6.6 billion of total funding 
    in the last decade.<br/>
    <br/>
    As shown in the left bar graph, the fundings to EdTech unicorns were increasing rapidly in the last five years.
    EdTech Unicorns are centered in three countries, China, United States and India. It shows that there are a large
    group of potential customers in these three countries possibly due to the large population base and also the emphasis on education.<br/>
    <br/>To further look at the companies, the names of the EdTech Unicorns in 2019 are given in the right donut chart by country.
    As you can see, almost all of them focus on online learning education services. It gives an insight that e-learning is 
    increasingly popular these days. With the assumption that online education could help to promote equality education, e-learning can
    provide diverse learning resources and step towards equal education.
